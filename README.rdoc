== Description

Nice-FFI is a layer on top of Ruby-FFI [1] (and compatible FFI
systems) with features to ease development of FFI-based libraries.

Nice-FFI currently features:

* NiceFFI::Library: a stand-in for FFI::Library that provides methods
  for easily finding and loading libraries on any platform, plus
  automatic wrapping of functions that return struct pointers.

* NiceFFI::PathSet: a class with customizable rules for finding
  library files on multiple operating system. PathSet is used by
  NiceFFI::Library.load_library.

* NiceFFI::Struct: a stand-in for FFI::Struct that provides automatic
  accessors for struct members, optional automatic memory management,
  more instance initialization options, pretty to_s and inspect
  methods, and other niceties.

* NiceFFI::OpaqueStruct: a base class for structs with no user-exposed
  members. Useful when the struct definition is hidden by the
  underlying C library.

Nice-FFI was originally developed as part of Ruby-SDL-FFI [2].

== Caveats

Nice-FFI is still in EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGES. That means:

* It may not work correctly (or at all).
* It may not be complete.
* It may change drastically with no advanced notice.

As such, this library is currently FOR THE ADVENTUROUS ONLY.
If you are not willing to continuously update your code to
match the new API, then you should wait until version 1.0.


== Requirements

* Ruby-FFI  >= 0.5.0 (or compatible FFI implementation)


== Usage

See docs/usage.rdoc for usage information.
